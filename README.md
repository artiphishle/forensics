# Forensics

Tool to visualize packages and their dependencies between each other. This project is inspired by [socomo](https://github.com/gdela/socomo).

Good software architecture starts with matching functional requirements to code structure.
Visualizing and showing the dependencies of packages in your project is the first step to regain control of your project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have PNPM & Node installed, check `package.json` for allowed versions

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Create your .env file
cp .env.tpl .env

# 3. Supply the project path to analyze in the .env file

# 4. Run the app
pnpm run dev
```
